title: A little about me!

I'm a mechanical engineer by training but a software developer by trade. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Nascent Digital. As a developer with an engineering background and mindset, I'm really passionate about building things that help make the world a better place and I've found that's where I get into my flow state.

Some of my past software projects include launching and scaling a video call platform for veterinarian consults, building out marketing web pages for multinational corporations, as well as maintaining a large legacy wealth management software suite. Before my life in software, I have had work experiences in different roles in manufacturing, logistics and robotics. 

My superpower as a professional is collaboration and teamwork and one of my favorite things is celebrating a hard fought win with the team.

In my free time, I use my superpower playing sports like volleyball and basketball.
